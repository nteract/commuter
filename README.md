As commuters, we rush around from place to place all day. We go to work,
school, and stores. We travel to locations near and far. Eventually, we
return to our cozy home. :car: :office: :airplane: :tokyo_tower: :bullettrain_side: :department_store: :bus: :school: :bike: :city_sunset: :runner: :house_with_garden:

Like commuters, our data travels around too. Sometimes we need a notebook at
work and other times at a client's site. Wherever and whenever you need your
notebooks, **commuter** has you covered.

## What is "commuter"?

As an opinionated [nteract](https://nteract.io) focused server, **commuter**
reads notebooks from a local directory or Amazon S3, has a directory explorer to find notebooks,
and provides a jupyter compatible version of the contents API. You determine
where your notebooks should reside and where they should be shared. Flexibility
and convenience.

Try **commuter** today and take your notebooks wherever you need them.

## Installation

You may use whichever package manager (`npm` or `yarn`) best suits your workflow. The `nteract` team internally uses `yarn`.

```
npm install @nteract/commuter -g
# OR
yarn global add @nteract/commuter
```

## Usage

Configure and run commuter with environment variables and `commuter server`.

Example local run (using a network file share!):

```sh
COMMUTER_LOCAL_STORAGE_BASEDIRECTORY=/efs/users/ commuter
```

Example S3 run:

```sh
COMMUTER_BUCKET=sweet-notebooks commuter
```
