# com·mut·er

> /kəˈmyo͞odər/
> a person who travels some distance to work on a regular basis.

As commuters, we rush around from place to place all day. We go to work,
school, and stores. We travel to locations near and far. Eventually, we
return to our cozy home. :car: :office: :airplane: :tokyo_tower: :bullettrain_side: :department_store: :bus: :school: :bike: :city_sunset: :runner: :house_with_garden:

Like commuters, our data travels around too. Sometimes we need a notebook at
work and other times at a client's site. Wherever and whenever you need your
notebooks, **commuter** has you covered.

## What is "commuter"?

As an opinionated [nteract](https://nteract.io) focused server, **commuter**
reads notebooks from a local directory or Amazon S3, has a directory explorer to find notebooks,
and provides a jupyter compatible version of the contents API. You determine
where your notebooks should reside and where they should be shared. Flexibility
and convenience.

Try **commuter** today and take your notebooks wherever you need them.
